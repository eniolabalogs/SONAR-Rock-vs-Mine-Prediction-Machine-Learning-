<h1>SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction (Machine Learning Project)</h1>
<p> This is a machine learning system in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR Data. </p>
<p>For this use case, we are using the Logistic Regression Model for our prediction </p>
<p>Considering that there is a submarine and a war, and the enemy countries have planted some mines in the ocean. Under the water, there are also rocks. This machine-learning model will 
help to determine whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock. </p>
<p>This is done by the submarine sending sonar signals and receiving feedback, then the feedback would be processed to know if it is a mine or a rock.
In the lab setup, we can get the sonar data since the mines and rocks are different materials.</p>
<p>We then feed this sonar data into the machine learning model to find out what material it is and match it to its corresponding object.</p>

<p><h1>Work Flow
 <h2>Sonar Data - Data pre- processing- Train, Test, Split - Logistic Regression model</h2></h1></p>

<p>We used the Logistic Regression model because the problem is a binary classification problem. It is just between a Rock and a Mine</p>

<p>A sample sonar data is in the repository</p>
